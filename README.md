AI Scheduling Agent

This repository contains an AI-powered scheduling system that integrates a Spring Boot backend with an LLM-based agent, enabling users to create calendar events via natural language and synchronize them with external services such as Notion.

The project demonstrates LLM-to-system integration, robust backend design, and production-style configuration management using environment variables and Docker.
